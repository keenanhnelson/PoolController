# Pool Controller

This project allows a user to control a pool from any where in the world using their smart phone. It is implemented in a Rude Goldberg-esque fashion using a robot to push buttons on a pool remote. This isn't really a very practical approach and is mostly used as a tool for learning about cross compilation, 3D modeling, 3D printing, Raspberry Pi, Motor control, networking, and dealing with images.
