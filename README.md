# Pool Controller

This project allows a user to control a pool from any where in the world using their smart phone. It is implemented in a Rude Goldberg-esque fashion using a robot to push buttons on a pool remote. This isn't really a very practical approach and is mostly used as a tool for learning about cross compilation, 3D modeling, 3D printing, Raspberry Pi, Motor control, networking, and dealing with images.

## Cloning project

This is the top level of the Pool Controller project. Most of the components are submodules so make sure to run the following command to get all of the submodules
